# Enigma-Machine-Theory
This is a brief program that uses many of the theories behind the operation of the original enigma machine.
Certain aspects, like the plugboard and more specific rotor settings, are not included to streamline the
process for less experienced users, but the theory behind the rotors and the way they change and interact is all
present. The rotors were generated using random non-repeating number sequences.
At the moment, support for reading from and writing to files is still in progress.
